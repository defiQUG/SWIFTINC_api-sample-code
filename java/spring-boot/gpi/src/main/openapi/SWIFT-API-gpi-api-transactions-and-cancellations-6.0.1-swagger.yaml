  description: "Retrieve status and payment events from the tracker\n\n*v6.0.0 Release Notes*\n\n* Introduction of new element MasterUetr and Subuetr both at transaction level as well as at payment event level to support the split payment process (see FIT rulebook for more information)\n* Introduction of new element named skipped indicator at transaction level which indicates that there are no payment events present due to schema compliance issues in payment messages involved in the transation.\n* Introduction of new code value SPLI in the Service level element (payment event level) in order to support the split payments process (see FIT rulebook for more information)\n* TransactionStatus, TransactionStatusDate, TransactionStatusReason, RejectReturnReason are replaced by EventStatus, EventStatusDate, EventStatusReason and EventRejectReturnReason respectively to clearly distinguish between those elements at payment event level and comparable elements at the transaction level of the GET API\n* Introduction of new element named TrackedMessageIdentification which may be present in the payment event related to a pacs.004 return that is being tracked and that does not contain an original instruction identification since the return is following a different route than the original underlying payment. The TrackedMessageIdentification allows in such case a better reconciliation between the pacs.004 and its related payment event. More information on this element in the rulebook sections related to returns\n* This contract does no longer contain the PUT Cancel Transaction and the PUT Transaction Cancellation Status APIs as a separate v6 contract has been created for those. Note that the v6 GET APIs in this contract still allow the user to obtain Stop and Recall information but it is recommended to use the GET v6 APIs in the specific Stop and Recall contract instead.\n* Introduction of new elements named TechnicalSender and TechnicalReceiver at payment event level that will be present for tracked pacs messages and reflect the technical header sender and receiver of the message. In the V-Shape MI context, these fields will allow to distinguish between a first leg from the bank to the MI and the second leg from the MI to the receiving bank.\n* Introduction of new element named Purpose Code which could be present with the value DEBT in case it is present in a pacs.009 settling charges payable by the debtor in relation to an underlying customer credit transfer (see FIT rulebook for more information)\n* Tracker Event Type RFTS which was missing in the enum in v5 has been added.\n* Last Update Date Time at Payment Event level was replaced by Event Creation Date Time\n* Introduction of new element named DebtorAccount. This element may be used in future but is conditional on approval of the necessary data access approvals\n
    \nv6.0.1 Release Notes*\n\n* Changed length of ExternalInvalidEventReasonCode back to 9 characters"

      Payment Transactions - Getting a Payment Transaction

      Purpose of the API
      * This API is a payment query to get detailed information regarding a given payment. It requires the UETR to be known.
      
      Examples of use cases are
      * gCCT Debtor Agent* status check - A gCCT Debtor Agent wants to see the transaction status and transaction details of a gCCT transaction in progress. 
      * gCCT Creditor Agent* status check - A gCCT Creditor Agent wants to have advance visibility on the progress and details of a gCCT transaction.
      * gCOV/gFIT Debtor/Debtor Agent status check - A gCOV/gFIT Debtor or Debtor Agent wants to see the transaction status and transaction details of respectively a gCOV/gFIT transaction in progress.
      * gCOV/gFIT Creditor/Creditor Agent status check - A gCOV/gFIT Creditor or Creditor Agent wants to have advance visibility on the progress and details of a gCOV/gFIT transaction.

      Purpose of the API
      * This API is a delta query to get all payment update information starting from a given date and time. This API allows synchronization of a local database with the Tracker database. There is a paging mechanism in case the response becomes too large. This is done through returning a "next" token in the response, so that the delta query can continue from the last returned result.

      description: |-
        
        The access token obtained as a result of OAuth 2.0 flows. SWIFT supports two OAuth grant types depending on the API service.
        * JWT-Bearer grant type [RFC 7523](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523)
        * Password grant type
        
        This API uses JWT-Bearer grant type.
        
        Please visit [SWIFT OAuth Token API](https://developer.swift.com/swift-oauth-token-api) page for more information and examples on how to generate an OAuth token.
          
        In this declaration only the basic security element to transport the bearer token of an OAuth2 process is declared.
